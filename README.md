digit-recognition-using-neural-nets
===================================

I've used the dataset from http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 grayscale image. The grayscale values have been converted from 0-255 to 0-1.

it is a 784 x 25 x 10 feed forward neural net with sigmoid activation function.

Accuracy : 92.84 %
